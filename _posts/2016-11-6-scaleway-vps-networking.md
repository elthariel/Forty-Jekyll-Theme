title: Benchmarkin Scaleway's VPS internal bandwidth
description: Just a quick benchmark with iperf
image:
---

While I was having fun planning a few personal deployments on
Scaleway's infrastructure, I wondered what was the internal bandwidth
allocated to the VPS. They provide those numbers for the bare metal
instances but I haven't been able to find anything about the VPS.

I ran a few benchmarks with the `iperf` tool to get a rough idea. I'm
testing with a C1, two C2S, a VC1S and a VC1M.

Let's point out that those are quick and dirty benchmarks, that I'm no
networking expert, that I haven't paid attention to actual server
location in the DC and that I know nothing about their network topology.

## C2S <-> C1

Server is on the `C2S`.

At least a benchmark with expected results :)

## Conclusion

So, it seems there's some burst mechanism in place for C1 and VPS,
allowing you to access the claimed bandwidth for a few seconds, then
throttling you to around 600Mbits/s.

On the VPS, the birst time is about 1-2 seconds. Let's add that the
network card seems shared with other users on the same physical server
(Yeah, kinda logical). So your actual interal bandwidth can vary and
drop below the 600Mbits/s depending on the servermates usage.

On the C1, the burst time is around 20s, which seems reasonnable for a
lot of use cases.

On the C2S, I haven't been able to notice such a burst time limit, but
I haven't been patient enough to test it for more than a minute.

Finally, I've mixed feeling about this issue. I'm kinda disappointed
about this burst thing on VPS/C1, but on the other hand, it's still a
great value for 2 euros per month :D
